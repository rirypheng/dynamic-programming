###Analogy
How do you put together a jigsaw puzzle?  You find pieces that fit together and connect them.  What happens when you connect two big chunks of pieces together?  You get an even bigger chunk. Dynamic Programming is the same kind of thing.  You solve the easy small problems first (finding individual pieces that fit together), and then use the results to solve the larger problem (combining all the little pieces into the whole puzzle).
